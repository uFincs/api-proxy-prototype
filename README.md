# uFincs API Proxy Prototype

The following is a prototype for what I'm calling the "uFincs API Proxy". Basically, because of how the encryption works in uFincs, you can't just make calls directly to the Backend API. You instead need a 'proxy' to handle doing the encryption/decryption, ala how the Frontend works.
